## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a full-stack web application where I handle everything from frontend interfaces using React and TypeScript, to backend APIs built with Flask, and PostgreSQL for data storage. The project emphasizes clean architecture, real-world data handling, authentication, and deployment workflows. It’s helping me deepen my understanding of building scalable, maintainable systems end-to-end.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning distributed systems, backend infrastructure, and low-level system design
